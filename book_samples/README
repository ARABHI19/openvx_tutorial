This is a collection of code samples for using the OpenVX API. The samples are
reviewed in detail by the OpenVX Programming Guide [1]. The data for running
the code samples is available from
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/urzzs64a85tqf3d/AADxdIEer_tjHFGzBifZWhsLa.

Prerequisites
- C and C++ compilers
- CMake 2.8.9 or higher
- OpenCV is required for building some of the samples (*.cpp)
- vxa library is required for the most of the OpenVX samples. It can be
downloaded from https://github.com/relrotciv/vxa.
- OpenVX (the most of the samples have been tested against the OpenVX sample
implementation that can be downloaded from
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenVX-sample-impl)
- LAPACK is required for building the birdsEyeView.c sample

BUILDING SAMPLES

In order to build the samples for Linux please follow the following steps:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
$ make
